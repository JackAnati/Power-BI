# Power-BI

**There are three primary components to Power BI:**
- Power BI Desktop (desktop application)
- Power BI service (online platform)
- Power BI Mobile (cross-platform mobile app)
Power BI Desktop is the development tool available to data analysts and other report creators. While the Power BI service allows you to organize, manage, and distribute your reports and other Power BI items. Power BI Desktop is available to download for free either through the Windows store or directly online.

**Building blocks of Power BI**

The building blocks of Power BI are semantic models and visualizations. Create a semantic model and then use visuals to build a report. Let's explore these items in more detail and how they relate to the flow of Power BI.

**Create visualizations in a report**

In Power BI Desktop, when you create a visualization (also called visual), you add it to the canvas for a report page. Choose your visualizations to build pages in your report. It's ideal to keep each page simple with related data, so consumers can easily see the insights.

**Power BI is a low-code solution**, which means that you can "drag and drop" data field directly onto the canvas. Power BI will choose a visual for your data field. You can easily change between visuals for the same fields, and add or remove data fields to the visual.

**Create a dashboard**
In the Power BI service, you can also create dashboards after you've published a report. Dashboards consist of a single page made up of tiles. Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard. Tiles aren't interactive like visuals, so when a user interacts with the tile, they go to the underlying report for more information.
