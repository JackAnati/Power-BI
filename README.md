# Power-BI

**There are three primary components to Power BI:**
- Power BI Desktop (desktop application)
- Power BI service (online platform)
- Power BI Mobile (cross-platform mobile app)
Power BI Desktop is the development tool available to data analysts and other report creators. While the Power BI service allows you to organize, manage, and distribute your reports and other Power BI items. Power BI Desktop is available to download for free either through the Windows store or directly online.

**Building blocks of Power BI**

The building blocks of Power BI are semantic models and visualizations. Create a semantic model and then use visuals to build a report. Let's explore these items in more detail and how they relate to the flow of Power BI.

**Create visualizations in a report**

In Power BI Desktop, when you create a visualization (also called visual), you add it to the canvas for a report page. Choose your visualizations to build pages in your report. It's ideal to keep each page simple with related data, so consumers can easily see the insights.

**Power BI is a low-code solution**, which means that you can "drag and drop" data field directly onto the canvas. Power BI will choose a visual for your data field. You can easily change between visuals for the same fields, and add or remove data fields to the visual.

**Create a dashboard**
In the Power BI service, you can also create dashboards after you've published a report. Dashboards consist of a single page made up of tiles. Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard. Tiles aren't interactive like visuals, so when a user interacts with the tile, they go to the underlying report for more information.

**Power BI Desktop has three views:**
- Report view: You can create queries to build compelling visualizations that you can share with others. You can arrange them as you want them to appear.
- Data view: See the data in your report in data model format, where you can add measures, create new columns, and manage relationships.
- Model view: Get a graphical representation of the relationships that are established in your data model and manage or modify them as needed.

**Power BI has multiple insights features that use artificial intelligence (AI):**

- Insights for reports: Analyzes data and finds anomalies and trends in your data as you interact with reports.
- Insights for individual visuals: Analyzes and explains the fluctuations of data points in visuals.
- Insights for dashboard tiles: Looks at the data being used to render that tile and presents them in interactive visuals.
- Quick Insights for datasets: Automatically generate data insights on a dataset in the Power BI service.
- AI Insights for data models in Power Query: Provide access to pretrained machine learning models from Azure Cognitive Services.

# Insights
The Insights pane currently shows three types of insights:
- Anomalies: Represents something that is out of the ordinary from what is expected. For example, a smart thermostat that suddenly reads the temperature as 100 F when it's typically 72 F would be considered an anomaly.
- Trends: Represents a pattern that is found in time-series datasets. For example, if a companyâ€™s sales are steadily increasing through the month of April that would represent a trend.
- Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis: Helps you evaluate the current value against a defined target. For example, a company might set a sales goal at 1.2 million, but currently they are at 1 million.

# Anomalies
An anomaly is an abnormality in time-series data, such as unexpected spikes and dips in the data. An algorithm computes a boundary around what is considered a normal or expected value. Any value found outside this boundary is marked as an anomaly.

There are three types of anomaly insights:
- Significant anomaly: The anomaly has a high score. Anomaly score indicates how far the point is from the expected range.
- Recent anomaly: The most recent anomaly in the measure.
- Anomaly summary: This insight type summarizes multiple anomalies in the measure.

When an anomaly in your data is flagged, Power BI runs an analysis across the different dimensions in your data model to look for spikes or dips in the measure that correlates to the anomaly. They're shown as possible explanations ranked by strength.


# Trends
A trend occurs when there's a prolonged increase or decrease in time-series data. There are a series of steps the Power BI algorithm uses to find meaningful trends. It first performs data smoothening, interpolation, and time-series sampling. The trends are then identified for statistical significance based on the slope and length of a change in value. The algorithm removes noise like seasonality and outliers. For example, if sales jump in December, the algorithm doesn't mark that as a noteworthy trend because it's common for sales to jump around the holidays.

There are four main trends flagged:
- Long trend: The trend is significant and is the longest trend within a single series or across multiple series in a visual.
- Steep trend: The trend is significant and is the steepest trend within a single series or across multiple series in a visual.
- Recent trend: The trend is significant and is the most recent trend within a single series or across multiple series in a visual.
- Trend reversal: Recent trend in a single series or across multiple series in a visual where the reversal is significant, compared to the previous trend segment.
